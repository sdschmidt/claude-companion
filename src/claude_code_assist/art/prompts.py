"""Sprite-sheet prompt builder + locomotion override surface.

The prompt asks Gemini to render a 2x5 portrait grid (10 cells) on a
flat magenta background. The four locomotion descriptors come from the
companion's profile by default; ``LocomotionOverrides`` lets the
``companion art → adapt`` flow override them per-generation without
mutating the saved profile.
